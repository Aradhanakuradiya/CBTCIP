This is my github repository for my internship tasks as a c++ intern in cipher byte technologies.
IDE used Code:: Blocks.
Task 1 is a digital calculator, which allows us to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication,trignometric functions etc. 
Task 2 is the student record management system, which allow us to store students information like name, roll.no, marks,grade.
It allows us to insert, update, delete the record.
